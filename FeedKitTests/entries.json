Be a better sniper! Could you do all that and more with just a zap to the noggin? Maybe.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sally Adee, an editor at New Scientist, was at a conference for DARPA - The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency - when she heard about a way to speed up learning with something called trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). A couple years later, Sally found herself weilding an M4 assualt rifle, picking off enemy combatants with a battery wired to her temple. Of course, it was a simulation, but Sally's sniper skills made producer Soren Wheeler wonder what we should think of the world of brain stimulation. </p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In the last couple years, tDCS has been all over the news. Researchers claim that juicing the brain with just 2 milliamps (think 9-volt battery) can help with everything from learning languages, to quitting smoking, to overcoming depression. We bring Michael Weisend, neuroscientist at Wright State Research Institute, into the studio to tell us how it works (Bonus: you get to hear Jad get his brain zapped). Peter Reiner and Nick Fitz of the University of British Columbia help us think through the consequences of a world where anyone with 20 dollars and access to Radioshack can make their own brain zapper. And finally, Sally tells us about the unexpected after-effects of a day of super-charged sniper training and makes us wonder about world where you can order up a state of mind.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"> </p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Special thanks for the music of <a href=\"http://ghosttrainorchestra.com/\">Brian Carpenter's Ghost Train Orchestra</a></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"> </p>",

The audio has been adjusted to reflect this fact. Cary Fukunaga (brilliantly) directed season one of True Detective. </p>",

We go looking for an answer.</p>\n<p>When Jad started to compose music for <a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/live/\">our live show Apocalyptical</a>, he immediately thought of John Luther Adams. <a href=\"http://cantaloupemusic.com/albums/become-ocean\">Adams' symphony “Become Ocean</a>,” rooted in the sounds of nature, is elemental, tectonic, and unstoppable.

Through interviews and snippets of his music, it captures all the forces at play in Adam's work and reveals the dark majesty of Adams' take on the apocalypse.</p>",

NPR's Invisibilia's originally included Paige's birth name in this piece due to a miscommunication between Invisibilia's reporter, Alix Spiegel and Paige. We have not been in contact with Paige directly, but NPR has issued the following statement from Anne Gudenkauf, senior supervising editor of NPR's science desk: \"We would never have violated Paige’s wishes in this story; it’s an unfortunate misunderstanding.  Invisibilia's upcoming episode on Paige will be edited to remove references to the name she no longer recognizes. Also the upcoming episode, which focuses on how categories affect us all, will explore in more depth the changes in Paige's life over the two years that she and Alix have spoken and will do that, as always, with attention to bi-gender and transgender reporting guidelines.\"\nFormer Radiolab producer Lulu Miller and NPR reporter Alix Spiegel come to the studio to give us a sneak peak of their new show, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/\">Invisibilia</a>.\n<p>Invisibilia has an upcoming episode about categories, so Alix tells us a story about two very basic categories: boy and girl. We've heard lots of stories about the sometimes blurry boundaries between boy and girl, but Alix introduces us to someone who experiences those categories in a way that was totally, completely new to us.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

It’s the most popular sport in the US, shining a sometimes harsh light on so much of what we have been, what we are, and what we hope to be. Savage, creative, brutal and balletic, whether you love it or loathe it … it’s a touchstone of the American identity.\n<p>Along with conflicted parents and players and coaches who aren’t sure if the game will survive, we take a deep dive into the surprising history of how the game came to be. At the end of the 19th century, football is a nascent and nasty sport. The sons of the most powerful men in the country are literally knocking themselves out to win these gladiatorial battles. But then the Carlisle Indian School, formed in 1879 to assimilate the children and grandchildren of the Native American men who fought the final Plains Wars, fields the most American team of all. The kids at Carlisle took the field to face off against a new world that was destroying theirs, and along the way, they changed the fundamentals of football forever. </p>\nCorrection: An earlier version of this episode included a few errors that we have corrected. We've also added one new piece of information. \nThe piece originally stated that British football had no referees.  While this was true in the earliest days of British football, they were eventually added. We stated that referees were added to American football in response to Pop Warner. American referees existed prior to Pop Warner, in order to address brutality as well as the kind of rule-bending that Pop Warner specialized in.\nChuck Klosterman said that the three most popular sports in the US are football, college football and major league baseball. In fact, baseball actually ranks 2nd, college football is third.\nMonet Edwards stated that 33 members of her family were players in the NFL. That number is actually 13. \nWe also added one new fact: over 200 students at The Carlisle Indian School died of malnutrition, poor health or distress from homesickness. <br /><br />\nThe audio has been adjusted to reflect these corrections.",

So she spoke with historians, dug through the National Archives and oral histories, and uncovered the astonishing story of a small town in Alabama overwhelmed by thousands of German prisoners of war.  Along the way, she discovered that a very fundamental question  - one that we are struggling with today  -  was playing out seventy years ago in hundreds of towns across America: When your enemy is at your mercy, how should you treat them? Karen helps Jad and Robert try to figure out why we did what we did then, and why we are doing things so differently now.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">CORRECTION: A previous version of this podcast stated that the Nuremberg Laws and the Mississippi Black Code could be viewed side by side at a museum in Nuremberg.

No, it’s not a robot or the latest dating app, it’s a method for genetic manipulation that is rewriting the way we change DNA.

With a small plane and a 44 mega-pixel camera, they figured out how to watch an entire city all at once, all day long. Whenever a bomb detonated, they could zoom onto that spot and then, because this eye in the sky had been there all along, they could scroll back in time and see - literally see - who planted it. After the war, Ross McNutt retired from the airforce, and brought this technology back home with him. Manoush Zomorodi and Alex Goldmark from the podcast “Note to Self” give us the low-down on Ross’s unique brand of persistent surveillance, from Juarez, Mexico to Dayton, Ohio. Then, once we realize what we can do, we wonder whether we should.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Dan Tucker and George Schulz.</p>\n<p>More info:</p>\nListen to Note to Self's episode on <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 9.5pt;\" href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/stingray-conspiracy-theory-daniel-rigmaiden-radiolab/\">surveillance coverage</a>.\n<a style=\"line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 9.5pt;\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/new-surveillance-technology-can-track-everyone-in-an-area-for-several-hours-at-a-time/2014/02/05/82f1556e-876f-11e3-a5bd-844629433ba3_story.html\">\"New surveillance technology can track everyone in an area for several hours at a time,\"</a> from the Washington Post\n<a style=\"line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 9.5pt;\" href=\"http://cironline.org/reports/hollywood-style-surveillance-technology-inches-closer-reality-6228\">\"Hollywood-style surveillance technology inches closer to reality,\"</a> from the Center of Investigative Reporting\nRoss McNutt's company <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 9.5pt;\" href=\"http://www.pss-1.com/\">Persistent Surveillance Systems</a>\n",

This episode contains strong language.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/radiolab/~4/B3W-Nc51Hb0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/><p>Back in 2014, Corey Knowlton paid $350,000 for a hunting trip to Namibia to shoot and kill an endangered species.  He’s a professional hunter, who guides hunts all around the world, so going to Africa would be nothing new.  The target on the other hand would be. And so too, he quickly found, would be the attention. </p>\n<p>This episode, producer Simon Adler follows Corey as he dodges death threats and prepares to pull the trigger.  Along the way we stop to talk with Namibian hunters and government officials, American activists, and someone who's been here before - Kenya’s former Director of Wildlife, Richard Leakey.   All the while, we try to uncover what conservation really means in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>Produced by Simon Adler with help from Matthew Kielty.</p>\n<br class=\"Apple-interchange-newline\" />Special thanks to Chris Weaver, Ian Wallace, Mark Barrow, the Lindstrom family, and everyone at the Aru Game Lodge in Namibia.\n<p>Thanks also to Sarah Fogel, Ray Crow, Barbara Clucus, Diogo Veríssimo</p>\n<p> </p>",

Cyber criminals today have more sophisticated tools, have learned to work collaboratively around the world and have found innovative ways to remain deep undercover in the internet's shadows. This episode, we shine a light into those shadows to see the world from the perspectives of both cybercrime victims and perpetrators.</p>\n<p>First we meet mother-daughter duo Alina and Inna Simone, who tell us about being held hostage by criminals who have burrowed into their lives from half a world away. Along the way we learn about the legally sticky spot that unwitting accomplices like Will Wheeler find themselves in.</p>\n<p>Then reporter and author Joseph Menn tells us about the surprisingly lucrative professional hacker structure in places throughout the former Soviet Union. Finally, the co-creator of one of the most notorious online marketplaces to ever exist speaks to us and NPR cyber-crime expert Dina Temple-Raston about how a young suburban Boy Scout can turn into a world renowned black hat hacker.</p>\n<p>Produced by Kelsey Padgett and Andy Mills. </p>",
