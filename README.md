# FeedKit

The FeedKit framework provides feeds and entries. It implements searching, browsing, and caching feeds, as well as subscription management for a single user.

## Core

The FeedKit framework is focussed around feeds and their entries. Its purpose is providing these items.

```swift
struct Feed
```

A feed is identified by its URL, it contains information about the feed.

```swift
struct Entry
```

An entry is related to a single feed by its URL and contains information specific to a single item *within* the feed. Since FeedKit prefers flat data structures, calling entries children of feeds would not be correct.

## Cache

FeedKit maintains a local cache of feeds, entries, and search results.

## Search

To get data into the system you have to discover it first.

## Browsing

Access specific entries and ranges of entries with locators.

## User

FeedKit manages feed subscriptions of a single user.
